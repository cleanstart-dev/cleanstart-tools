## Sign images for authenticity and verify their integrity.

- For image signing and verification, both a public key and a private key are required.

### Note:
We are using python-test:latest, python:latest images here.
- python-test:latest - custom image build using python-test.yaml configuration, in /build and push/README.md 
- python:latest - public image of python

you can generate private and public key using below commands.

```bash
# Private key can be generated using this command
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out private-key.pem
```
```bash
# Public key can be generated using this command
openssl pkey -in private-key.pem -pubout -out public-key.pem
```
### Image Signing

Cryptographically signs an image to attest integrity and provenance.

you can generate private and public key using below commands

```bash
# Sign image (requires key file genearted from previous step)
clnstrt sign -k private-key.pem python-test:latest -v
# refer output at /sign and verify/sign.txt

# Sign with config
clnstrt sign -k private-key.pem -c python-test.yaml python-test:latest -v
# refer output at /sign and verify/signwithconfig.txt
```

- Purpose: Signs the container image to provide authenticity and ensure it can be verified using the corresponding public key.
- How It Works: The clnstrt sign command uses the provided private key (private-key.pem) to create a cryptographic signature for the specified image (test-image:latest). This signature is embedded with the image's metadata. Signing an image allows users or systems to later verify its authenticity and integrity with the matching public key.
- Outcome: The image is signed successfully, and the signature is attached to it. This signature can later be verified using the clnstrt verify command and the corresponding public key.


### Image Verification

Verifies an imageâ€™s signature using a public key to ensure trust.

```bash
# Verify image signature (requires public key)
clnstrt verify -k public-key.pem python-test:latest -v
# refer output at /sign and verify/verify.txt

# Verify with config
clnstrt verify -k public-key.pem -c python-test.yaml python-test:latest -v
# refer output at /sign and verify/verifywithconfig.txt
```

Public key file for verification is required.

- Purpose: Verifies the authenticity and integrity of the image using a provided public key.
- How It Works: The clnstrt verify command takes the specified image (test-image:latest) and checks its signature against the provided public key (public-key.pem). This process confirms that the image was signed with the corresponding private key and ensures that the image has not been tampered with or altered after signing.
- Outcome: The command outputs a verification status indicating whether the signature is valid and if the image is intact. If successful, it confirms that the image's integrity is maintained.
