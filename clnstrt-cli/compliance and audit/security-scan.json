In ImageMagick versions prior to 7.1.2-7 and 6.9.13-32, an integer overflow vulnerability exists in the BMP decoder on 32-bit systems. The vulnerability occurs in coders/bmp.c when calculating the extent value by multiplying image columns by bits per pixel.

A specially crafted 58-byte BMP file with width set to 536,870,912 and 32 bits per pixel can trigger this overflow, causing the bytes_per_line calculation to become zero.

The vulnerability occurs in coders/bmp.c when calculating the extent value by multiplying image columns by bits per pixel. On 32-bit systems with size_t of 4 bytes, a malicious BMP file with specific dimensions can cause this multiplication to overflow and wrap to zero. The overflow check added to address CVE-2025-57803 is placed after the overflow occurs, making it ineffective. A specially crafted 58-byte BMP file with width set to 536,870,912 and 32 bits per pixel can trigger this overflow, causing the bytes_per_line calculation to become zero. This vulnerability only affects 32-bit builds of ImageMagick where default resource limits for width, height, and area have been manually increased beyond their defaults. 64-bit systems with size_t of 8 bytes are not vulnerable, and systems using default ImageMagick resource limits are not vulnerable. The vulnerability is fixed in versions 7.1.2-7 and 6.9.13-32."

Usually these RRSets are used to update the resolver's knowledge of the zone's name servers. A malicious actor can exploit the possible poisonous effect by injecting NS RRSets (and possibly their respective address records) in a reply. This could be done for example by trying to spoof a packet or fragmentation attacks. Unbound would then proceed to update the NS RRSet data it already has since the new data has enough trust for it, i.e., in-zone data for the delegation point. Unbound 1.24.1 includes a fix that scrubs unsolicited NS RRSets (and their respective address records) from replies mitigating the possible poison effect."

As a\nresult, a port will remain in the global router port list even after it\nis deleted. This will lead to a use-after-free [1] when the list is\ntraversed (when adding a new port to the list, for example):\n\n # ip link del dev dummy1\n # ip link add name dummy2 up master br1 type dummy\n # ip link set dev dummy2 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2\n\nSimilarly, stale entries can also be found in the per-VLAN router port\nlist.

      "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/sched: Fix backlog accounting in qdisc_dequeue_internal\n\nThis issue applies for the following qdiscs: hhf, fq, fq_codel, and\nfq_pie, and occurs in their change handlers when adjusting to the new\nlimit. The problem is the following in the values passed to the\nsubsequent qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog call given a tbf parent:\n\n   When the tbf parent runs out of tokens, skbs of these qdiscs will\n   be placed in gso_skb. Their peek handlers are qdisc_peek_dequeued,\n   which accounts for both qlen and backlog. However, in the case of\n   qdisc_dequeue_internal, ONLY qlen is accounted for when pulling\n   from gso_skb. This means that these qdiscs are missing a\n   qdisc_qstats_backlog_dec when dropping packets to satisfy the\n   new limit in their change handlers.\n\n   One can observe this issue with the following (with tc patched to\n   support a limit of 0):\n\n   export TARGET=fq\n   tc qdisc del dev lo root\n   tc qdisc add dev lo root handle 1: tbf rate 8bit burst 100b latency 1ms\n   tc qdisc replace dev lo handle 3: parent 1:1 $TARGET limit 1000\n   echo ''; echo 'add child'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo\n   ping -I lo -f -c2 -s32 -W0.001 127.0.0.1 2\u003e\u00261 \u003e/dev/null\n   echo ''; echo 'after ping'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo\n   tc qdisc change dev lo handle 3: parent 1:1 $TARGET limit 0\n   echo ''; echo 'after limit drop'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo\n   tc qdisc replace dev lo handle 2: parent 1:1 sfq\n   echo ''; echo 'post graft'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo\n\n   The second to last show command shows 0 packets but a positive\n   number (74) of backlog bytes. The problem becomes clearer in the\n   last show command, where qdisc_purge_queue triggers\n   qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog with the positive backlog and causes an\n   underflow in the tbf parent's backlog (4096 Mb instead of 0).\n\nTo fix this issue, the codepath for all clients of qdisc_dequeue_internal\nhas been simplified: codel, pie, hhf, fq, fq_pie, and fq_codel.\nqdisc_dequeue_internal handles the backlog adjustments for all cases that\ndo not directly use the dequeue handler.\n\nThe old fq_codel_change limit adjustment loop accumulated the arguments to\nthe subsequent qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog call through the cstats field.\nHowever, this is confusing and error prone as fq_codel_dequeue could also\npotentially mutate this field (which qdisc_dequeue_internal calls in the\nnon gso_skb case), so we have unified the code here with other qdiscs."

So pl-\u003ephydev-\u003elock needs to be\nacquired prior to pl-\u003estate_mutex.

Currently it is redundant, but it\nwill serve a functional purpose once mutex_lock(\u0026phy-\u003elock) will be\nmoved outside of the mutex_lock(\u0026pl-\u003estate_mutex) section.\n\nAnother alternative considered would have been to let phylink_resolve()\nacquire the rtnl_mutex, which is also held when phylink_bringup_phy()\nand phylink_disconnect_phy() are called. But since phylink_disconnect_phy()\nruns under rtnl_lock(), it would deadlock with phylink_resolve() when\ncalling flush_work(\u0026pl-\u003eresolve).

The file has the object as it's private_data and holds\na users refcount, while the object is expected to remain alive as long as\nthe file is.\n\nWhen the allocation of a new object aborts before installing the file it\nwill fput() the file and then go on to immediately kfree() the obj. This\ncauses a UAF once the workqueue completes the fput() and tries to\ndecrement the users refcount.\n\nFix this by putting the core code in charge of the file lifetime, and call\n__fput_sync() during abort to ensure that release() is called before\nkfree. __fput_sync() is a bit too tricky to open code in all the object\nimplementations. Instead the objects tell the core code where the file\npointer is and the core will take care of the life cycle.\n\nIf the object is successfully allocated then the file will hold a users\nrefcount and the iommufd_object cannot be destroyed.\n\nIt is worth noting that close(); ioctl(IOMMU_DESTROY); doesn't have an\nissue because close() is already using a synchronous version of fput().\n\nThe UAF looks like this:\n\n    BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in iommufd_eventq_fops_release+0x45/0xc0 drivers/iommu/iommufd/eventq.c:376\n    Write of size 4 at addr ffff888059c97804 by task syz.0.46/6164\n\n    CPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 6164 Comm: syz.0.46 Not tainted syzkaller #0 PREEMPT(full)\n    Hardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOS Google 08/18/2025\n    Call Trace:\n     \u003cTASK\u003e\n     __dump_stack lib/dump_stack.c:94 [inline]\n     dump_stack_lvl+0x116/0x1f0 lib/dump_stack.c:120\n     print_address_description mm/kasan/report.c:378 [inline]\n     print_report+0xcd/0x630 mm/kasan/report.c:482\n     kasan_report+0xe0/0x110 mm/kasan/report.c:595\n     check_region_inline mm/kasan/generic.c:183 [inline]\n     kasan_check_range+0x100/0x1b0 mm/kasan/generic.c:189\n     instrument_atomic_read_write include/linux/instrumented.h:96 [inline]\n     atomic_fetch_sub_release include/linux/atomic/atomic-instrumented.h:400 [inline]\n     __refcount_dec include/linux/refcount.h:455 [inline]\n     refcount_dec include/linux/refcount.h:476 [inline]\n     iommufd_eventq_fops_release+0x45/0xc0 drivers/iommu/iommufd/eventq.c:376\n     __fput+0x402/0xb70 fs/file_table.c:468\n     task_work_run+0x14d/0x240 kernel/task_work.c:227\n     resume_user_mode_work include/linux/resume_user_mode.h:50 [inline]\n     exit_to_user_mode_loop+0xeb/0x110 kernel/entry/common.c:43\n     exit_to_user_mode_prepare include/linux/irq-entry-common.h:225 [inline]\n     syscall_exit_to_user_mode_work include/linux/entry-common.h:175 [inline]\n     syscall_exit_to_user_mode include/linux/entry-common.h:210 [inline]\n     do_syscall_64+0x41c/0x4c0 arch/x86/entry/syscall_64.c:100\n     entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x77/0x7f"

Specifically, a VMA which has a valid pointer\nto vma-\u003evm_userfaultfd_ctx, but no UFFD flags in vma-\u003evm_flags.\n\nThe inconsistency is caused in ksm_madvise(): when user calls madvise()\nwith MADV_UNMEARGEABLE on a VMA that is registered for UFFD in MINOR mode,\nit accidentally clears all flags stored in the upper 32 bits of\nvma-\u003evm_flags.\n\nAssuming x86_64 kernel build, unsigned long is 64-bit and unsigned int and\nint are 32-bit wide.  This setup causes the following mishap during the \u0026=\n~VM_MERGEABLE assignment.\n\nVM_MERGEABLE is a 32-bit constant of type unsigned int, 0x8000'0000. \nAfter ~ is applied, it becomes 0x7fff'ffff unsigned int, which is then\npromoted to unsigned long before the \u0026 operation.  This promotion fills\nupper 32 bits with leading 0s, as we're doing unsigned conversion (and\neven for a signed conversion, this wouldn't help as the leading bit is 0).\n\u0026 operation thus ends up AND-ing vm_flags with 0x0000'0000'7fff'ffff\ninstead of intended 0xffff'ffff'7fff'ffff and hence accidentally clears\nthe upper 32-bits of its value.\n\nFix it by changing `VM_MERGEABLE` constant to unsigned long, using the\nBIT() macro.\n\nNote: other VM_* flags are not affected: This only happens to the\nVM_MERGEABLE flag, as the other VM_* flags are all constants of type int\nand after ~ operation, they end up with leading 1 and are thus converted\nto unsigned long with leading 1s.\n\nNote 2:\nAfter commit 31defc3b01d9 (\"userfaultfd: remove (VM_)BUG_ON()s\"), this is\nno longer a kernel BUG, but a WARNING at the same place:\n\n[   45.595973] WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 2474 at mm/userfaultfd.c:2067\n\nbut the root-cause (flag-drop) remains the same.\n\n[akpm@linux-foundation.org: rust bindgen wasn't able to handle BIT(), from Miguel]"

      "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nuio_hv_generic: Let userspace take care of interrupt mask\n\nRemove the logic to set interrupt mask by default in uio_hv_generic\ndriver as the interrupt mask value is supposed to be controlled\ncompletely by the user space. If the mask bit gets changed\nby the driver, concurrently with user mode operating on the ring,\nthe mask bit may be set when it is supposed to be clear, and the\nuser-mode driver will miss an interrupt which will cause a hang.\n\nFor eg- when the driver sets inbound ring buffer interrupt mask to 1,\nthe host does not interrupt the guest on the UIO VMBus channel.\nHowever, setting the mask does not prevent the host from putting a\nmessage in the inbound ring buffer. So let’s assume that happens,\nthe host puts a message into the ring buffer but does not interrupt.\n\nSubsequently, the user space code in the guest sets the inbound ring\nbuffer interrupt mask to 0, saying “Hey, I’m ready for interrupts”.\nUser space code then calls pread() to wait for an interrupt.\nThen one of two things happens:\n\n* The host never sends another message. So the pread() waits forever.\n* The host does send another message. But because there’s already a\n  message in the ring buffer, it doesn’t generate an interrupt.\n  This is the correct behavior, because the host should only send an\n  interrupt when the inbound ring buffer transitions from empty to\n  not-empty. Adding an additional message to a ring buffer that is not\n  empty is not supposed to generate an interrupt on the guest.\n  Since the guest is waiting in pread() and not removing messages from\n  the ring buffer, the pread() waits forever.\n\nThis could be easily reproduced in hv_fcopy_uio_daemon if we delay\nsetting interrupt mask to 0.\n\nSimilarly if hv_uio_channel_cb() sets the interrupt_mask to 1,\nthere’s a race condition. Once user space empties the inbound ring\nbuffer, but before user space sets interrupt_mask to 0, the host could\nput another message in the ring buffer but it wouldn’t interrupt.\nThen the next pread() would hang.\n\nFix these by removing all instances where interrupt_mask is changed,\nwhile keeping the one in set_event() unchanged to enable userspace\ncontrol the interrupt mask by writing 0/1 to /dev/uioX."

We handle this with the cifs_sg_set_buf() helper\nthat converts vmalloc'd memory to their corresponding pages.\n\nHowever, when we allocate our aead_request buffer (@creq in\nsmb2ops.c::crypt_message()), we do so with kvzalloc(), which possibly\nputs aead_request-\u003e__ctx in vmalloc area.\n\nAEAD algorithm then uses -\u003e__ctx for its private/internal data and\noperations, and uses sg_set_buf() for such data on a few places.\n\nThis works fine as long as @creq falls into kmalloc zone (small\nrequests) or vmalloc'd memory is still within linear range.\n\nTasks' stacks are vmalloc'd by default (CONFIG_VMAP_STACK=y), so too\nmany tasks will increment the base stacks' addresses to a point where\nvirt_addr_valid(buf) will fail (BUG() in sg_set_buf()) when that\nhappens.\n\nIn practice: too many parallel reads and writes on an encrypted mount\nwill trigger this bug.\n\nTo fix this, always alloc @creq with kmalloc() instead.\nAlso drop the @sensitive_size variable/arguments since\nkfree_sensitive() doesn't need it.\n\nBacktrace:\n\n[  945.272081] ------------[ cut here ]------------\n[  945.272774] kernel BUG at include/linux/scatterlist.h:209!\n[  945.273520] Oops: invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] SMP DEBUG_PAGEALLOC NOPTI\n[  945.274412] CPU: 7 UID: 0 PID: 56 Comm: kworker/u33:0 Kdump: loaded Not tainted 6.15.0-lku-11779-g8e9d6efccdd7-dirty #1 PREEMPT(voluntary)\n[  945.275736] Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS rel-1.16.3-2-gc13ff2cd-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014\n[  945.276877] Workqueue: writeback wb_workfn (flush-cifs-2)\n[  945.277457] RIP: 0010:crypto_gcm_init_common+0x1f9/0x220\n[  945.278018] Code: b0 00 00 00 48 83 c4 08 5b 5d 41 5c 41 5d 41 5e 41 5f c3 cc cc cc cc 48 c7 c0 00 00 00 80 48 2b 05 5c 58 e5 00 e9 58 ff ff ff \u003c0f\u003e 0b 0f 0b 0f 0b 0f 0b 0f 0b 0f 0b 48 c7 04 24 01 00 00 00 48 8b\n[  945.279992] RSP: 0018:ffffc90000a27360 EFLAGS: 00010246\n[  945.280578] RAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: ffffc90001d85060 RCX: 0000000000000030\n[  945.281376] RDX: 0000000000080000 RSI: 0000000000000000 RDI: ffffc90081d85070\n[  945.282145] RBP: ffffc90001d85010 R08: ffffc90001d85000 R09: 0000000000000000\n[  945.282898] R10: ffffc90001d85090 R11: 0000000000001000 R12: ffffc90001d85070\n[  945.283656] R13: ffff888113522948 R14: ffffc90001d85060 R15: ffffc90001d85010\n[  945.284407] FS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff8882e66cf000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\n[  945.285262] CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\n[  945.285884] CR2: 00007fa7ffdd31f4 CR3: 000000010540d000 CR4: 0000000000350ef0\n[  945.286683] Call Trace:\n[  945.286952]  \u003cTASK\u003e\n[  945.287184]  ? crypt_message+0x33f/0xad0 [cifs]\n[  945.287719]  crypto_gcm_encrypt+0x36/0xe0\n[  945.288152]  crypt_message+0x54a/0xad0 [cifs]\n[  945.288724]  smb3_init_transform_rq+0x277/0x300 [cifs]\n[  945.289300]  smb_send_rqst+0xa3/0x160 [cifs]\n[  945.289944]  cifs_call_async+0x178/0x340 [cifs]\n[  945.290514]  ? __pfx_smb2_writev_callback+0x10/0x10 [cifs]\n[  945.291177]  smb2_async_writev+0x3e3/0x670 [cifs]\n[  945.291759]  ? find_held_lock+0x32/0x90\n[  945.292212]  ? netfs_advance_write+0xf2/0x310\n[  945.292723]  netfs_advance_write+0xf2/0x310\n[  945.293210]  netfs_write_folio+0x346/0xcc0\n[  945.293689]  ? __pfx__raw_spin_unlock_irq+0x10/0x10\n[  945.294250]  netfs_writepages+0x117/0x460\n[  945.294724]  do_writepages+0xbe/0x170\n[  945.295152]  ? find_held_lock+0x32/0x90\n[  945.295600]  ? kvm_sched_clock_read+0x11/0x20\n[  945.296103]  __writeback_single_inode+0x56/0x4b0\n[  945.296643]  writeback_sb_inodes+0x229/0x550\n[  945.297140]  __writeback_inodes_wb+0x4c/0xe0\n[  945.297642]  wb_writeback+0x2f1/0x3f0\n[  945.298069]  wb_workfn+0x300/0x490\n[  945.298472]  process_one_work+0x1fe/0x590\n[  945.298949]  worker_thread+0x1ce/0x3c0\n[  945.299397]  ? __pfx_worker_thread+0x10/0x10\n[  945.299900]  kthr\n---truncated---"

This can overwrite the TASK_STATE_DRAINING state\nset by a concurrent call to rxe_cleanup_task() or rxe_disable_task().\n\nWhile state changes are protected by a spinlock, both rxe_cleanup_task()\nand rxe_disable_task() release the lock while waiting for the task to\nfinish draining in the while(!is_done(task)) loop. The race occurs if\ndo_task() hits its iteration limit and acquires the lock in this window.\nThe cleanup logic may then proceed while the task incorrectly\nreschedules itself, leading to a potential use-after-free.\n\nThis bug was introduced during the migration from tasklets to workqueues,\nwhere the special handling for the draining case was lost.\n\nFix this by restoring the original pre-migration behavior. If the state is\nTASK_STATE_DRAINING when iterations are exhausted, set cont to 1 to\nforce a new loop iteration. This allows the task to finish its work, so\nthat a subsequent iteration can reach the switch statement and correctly\ntransition the state to TASK_STATE_DRAINED, stopping the task as intended."

Various\ndrivers from various OSes supporting 10G adapters from Intel portfolio\ncould easily negotiate mailbox API.\n\nThis convention has been broken since introducing API 1.4.\nCommit 0062e7cc955e (\"ixgbevf: add VF IPsec offload code\") added support\nfor IPSec which is specific only for the kernel ixgbe driver. None of the\nrest of the Intel 10G PF/VF drivers supports it. And actually lack of\nsupport was not included in the IPSec implementation - there were no such\ncode paths. No possibility to negotiate support for the feature was\nintroduced along with introduction of the feature itself.\n\nCommit 339f28964147 (\"ixgbevf: Add support for new mailbox communication\nbetween PF and VF\") increasing API version to 1.5 did the same - it\nintroduced code supported specifically by the PF ESX driver. It altered API\nversion for the VF driver in the same time not touching the version\ndefined for the PF ixgbe driver. It led to additional discrepancies,\nas the code provided within API 1.6 cannot be supported for Linux ixgbe\ndriver as it causes crashes.\n\nThe issue was noticed some time ago and mitigated by Jake within the commit\nd0725312adf5 (\"ixgbevf: stop attempting IPSEC offload on Mailbox API 1.5\").\nAs a result we have regression for IPsec support and after increasing API\nto version 1.6 ixgbevf driver stopped to support ESX MBX.\n\nTo fix this mess add new mailbox op asking PF driver about supported\nfeatures. Basing on a response determine whether to set support for IPSec\nand ESX-specific enhanced mailbox.\n\nNew mailbox op, for compatibility purposes, must be added within new API\nrevision, as API version of OOT PF \u0026 VF drivers is already increased to\n1.6 and doesn't incorporate features negotiate op.\n\nFeatures negotiation mechanism gives possibility to be extended with new\nfeatures when needed in the future."

All the\nlocks are dropped before the exit_mmap() call (in mm/mmap.c), but the\nincomplete mm_struct can be reached through (at least) the rmap finding\nthe vmas which have a pointer back to the mm_struct.\n\nUp to this point, there have been no issues with being able to find an\nmm_struct that was only partially initialised.  Syzbot was able to make\nthe incomplete mm_struct fail with recent forking changes, so it has been\nproven unsafe to use the mm_struct that hasn't been initialised, as\nreferenced in the link below.\n\nAlthough 8ac662f5da19f (\"fork: avoid inappropriate uprobe access to\ninvalid mm\") fixed the uprobe access, it does not completely remove the\nrace.\n\nThis patch sets the MMF_OOM_SKIP to avoid the iteration of the vmas on the\noom side (even though this is extremely unlikely to be selected as an oom\nvictim in the race window), and sets MMF_UNSTABLE to avoid other potential\nusers from using a partially initialised mm_struct.\n\nWhen registering vmas for uprobe, skip the vmas in an mm that is marked\nunstable.  Modifying a vma in an unstable mm may cause issues if the mm\nisn't fully initialised."

      "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nblock: fix queue freeze vs limits lock order in sysfs store methods\n\nqueue_attr_store() always freezes a device queue before calling the\nattribute store operation. For attributes that control queue limits, the\nstore operation will also lock the queue limits with a call to\nqueue_limits_start_update(). However, some drivers (e.g. SCSI sd) may\nneed to issue commands to a device to obtain limit values from the\nhardware with the queue limits locked. This creates a potential ABBA\ndeadlock situation if a user attempts to modify a limit (thus freezing\nthe device queue) while the device driver starts a revalidation of the\ndevice queue limits.\n\nAvoid such deadlock by not freezing the queue before calling the\n-\u003estore_limit() method in struct queue_sysfs_entry and instead use the\nqueue_limits_commit_update_frozen helper to freeze the queue after taking\nthe limits lock.\n\nThis also removes taking the sysfs lock for the store_limit method as\nit doesn't protect anything here, but creates even more nesting.\nHopefully it will go away from the actual sysfs methods entirely soon.\n\n(commit log adapted from a similar patch from  Damien Le Moal)"

      "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: ath12k: Avoid memory leak while enabling statistics\n\nDriver uses monitor destination rings for extended statistics mode and\nstandalone monitor mode. In extended statistics mode, TLVs are parsed from\nthe buffer received from the monitor destination ring and assigned to the\nppdu_info structure to update per-packet statistics. In standalone monitor\nmode, along with per-packet statistics, the packet data (payload) is\ncaptured, and the driver updates per MSDU to mac80211.\n\nWhen the AP interface is enabled, only extended statistics mode is\nactivated. As part of enabling monitor rings for collecting statistics,\nthe driver subscribes to HAL_RX_MPDU_START TLV in the filter\nconfiguration. This TLV is received from the monitor destination ring, and\nkzalloc for the mon_mpdu object occurs, which is not freed, leading to a\nmemory leak. The kzalloc for the mon_mpdu object is only required while\nenabling the standalone monitor interface. This causes a memory leak while\nenabling extended statistics mode in the driver.\n\nFix this memory leak by removing the kzalloc for the mon_mpdu object in\nthe HAL_RX_MPDU_START TLV handling. Additionally, remove the standalone\nmonitor mode handlings in the HAL_MON_BUF_ADDR and HAL_RX_MSDU_END TLVs.\nThese TLV tags will be handled properly when enabling standalone monitor\nmode in the future.\n\nTested-on: QCN9274 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.WBE.1.3.1-00173-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1\nTested-on: WCN7850 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.HMT.1.0.c5-00481-QCAHMTSWPL_V1.0_V2.0_SILICONZ-3"

Such descriptors get skipped and don't get added\nas fragments in ice_add_xdp_frag. Since the buffer isn't counted as a\nfragment, we do not iterate over it in ice_put_rx_mbuf(), and thus we don't\ncall ice_put_rx_buf().\n\nBecause we don't call ice_put_rx_buf(), we don't attempt to re-use the\npage or free it. This leaves a stale page in the ring, as we don't\nincrement next_to_alloc.\n\nThe ice_reuse_rx_page() assumes that the next_to_alloc has been incremented\nproperly, and that it always points to a buffer with a NULL page. Since\nthis function doesn't check, it will happily recycle a page over the top\nof the next_to_alloc buffer, losing track of the old page.\n\nNote that this leak only occurs for multi-buffer frames. The\nice_put_rx_mbuf() function always handles at least one buffer, so a\nsingle-buffer frame will always get handled correctly. It is not clear\nprecisely why the hardware hands us descriptors with a size of 0 sometimes,\nbut it happens somewhat regularly with \"jumbo frames\" used by 9K MTU.\n\nTo fix ice_put_rx_mbuf(), we need to make sure to call ice_put_rx_buf() on\nall buffers between first_desc and next_to_clean. Borrow the logic of a\nsimilar function in i40e used for this same purpose. Use the same logic\nalso in ice_get_pgcnts().\n\nInstead of iterating over just the number of fragments, use a loop which\niterates until the current index reaches to the next_to_clean element just\npast the current frame. Unlike i40e, the ice_put_rx_mbuf() function does\ncall ice_put_rx_buf() on the last buffer of the frame indicating the end of\npacket.\n\nFor non-linear (multi-buffer) frames, we need to take care when adjusting\nthe pagecnt_bias. An XDP program might release fragments from the tail of\nthe frame, in which case that fragment page is already released. Only\nupdate the pagecnt_bias for the first descriptor and fragments still\nremaining post-XDP program. Take care to only access the shared info for\nfragmented buffers, as this avoids a significant cache miss.\n\nThe xdp_xmit value only needs to be updated if an XDP program is run, and\nonly once per packet. Drop the xdp_xmit pointer argument from\nice_put_rx_mbuf(). Instead, set xdp_xmit in the ice_clean_rx_irq() function\ndirectly. This avoids needing to pass the argument and avoids an extra\nbit-wise OR for each buffer in the frame.\n\nMove the increment of the ntc local variable to ensure its updated *before*\nall calls to ice_get_pgcnts() or ice_put_rx_mbuf(), as the loop logic\nrequires the index of the element just after the current frame.\n\nNow that we use an index pointer in the ring to identify the packet, we no\nlonger need to track or cache the number of fragments in the rx_ring."

      "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nksmbd: Fix race condition in RPC handle list access\n\nThe 'sess-\u003erpc_handle_list' XArray manages RPC handles within a ksmbd\nsession. Access to this list is intended to be protected by\n'sess-\u003erpc_lock' (an rw_semaphore). However, the locking implementation was\nflawed, leading to potential race conditions.\n\nIn ksmbd_session_rpc_open(), the code incorrectly acquired only a read lock\nbefore calling xa_store() and xa_erase(). Since these operations modify\nthe XArray structure, a write lock is required to ensure exclusive access\nand prevent data corruption from concurrent modifications.\n\nFurthermore, ksmbd_session_rpc_method() accessed the list using xa_load()\nwithout holding any lock at all. This could lead to reading inconsistent\ndata or a potential use-after-free if an entry is concurrently removed and\nthe pointer is dereferenced.\n\nFix these issues by:\n1. Using down_write() and up_write() in ksmbd_session_rpc_open()\n   to ensure exclusive access during XArray modification, and ensuring\n   the lock is correctly released on error paths.\n2. Adding down_read() and up_read() in ksmbd_session_rpc_method()\n   to safely protect the lookup."

This validation only\nvalidates the skb-\u003elen (directly reflects size provided at the\nuserspace interface) with the length provided in the buffer\nitself (interpreted as NCI_HEADER). This leads to the processing\nof memory content at the address assuming the correct layout\nper what opcode requires there. This leads to the accesses to\nbuffer of `skb_buff-\u003edata` which is not assigned anything yet.\n\nFollowing the same silent drop of packets of invalid sizes at\n`nic_valid_size()`, add validation of the data in the respective\nhandlers and return error values in case of failure. Release\nthe skb if error values are returned from handlers in\n`nci_nft_packet` and effectively do a silent drop\n\nPossible TODO: because we silently drop the packets, the\ncall to `nci_request` will be waiting for completion of request\nand will face timeouts. These timeouts can get excessively logged\nin the dmesg. A proper handling of them may require to export\n`nci_request_cancel` (or propagate error handling from the\nnft packets handlers)."

      "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfs/ntfs3: reject index allocation if $BITMAP is empty but blocks exist\n\nIndex allocation requires at least one bit in the $BITMAP attribute to\ntrack usage of index entries. If the bitmap is empty while index blocks\nare already present, this reflects on-disk corruption.\n\nsyzbot triggered this condition using a malformed NTFS image. During a\nrename() operation involving a long filename (which spans multiple\nindex entries), the empty bitmap allowed the name to be added without\nvalid tracking. Subsequent deletion of the original entry failed with\n-ENOENT, due to unexpected index state.\n\nReject such cases by verifying that the bitmap is not empty when index\nblocks exist."

      "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfs: ntfs3: Fix integer overflow in run_unpack()\n\nThe MFT record relative to the file being opened contains its runlist,\nan array containing information about the file's location on the physical\ndisk. Analysis of all Call Stack paths showed that the values of the\nrunlist array, from which LCNs are calculated, are not validated before\nrun_unpack function.\n\nThe run_unpack function decodes the compressed runlist data format\nfrom MFT attributes (for example, $DATA), converting them into a runs_tree\nstructure, which describes the mapping of virtual clusters (VCN) to\nlogical clusters (LCN). The NTFS3 subsystem also has a shortcut for\ndeleting files from MFT records - in this case, the RUN_DEALLOCATE\ncommand is sent to the run_unpack input, and the function logic\nprovides that all data transferred to the runlist about file or\ndirectory is deleted without creating a runs_tree structure.\n\nSubstituting the runlist in the $DATA attribute of the MFT record for an\narbitrary file can lead either to access to arbitrary data on the disk\nbypassing access checks to them (since the inode access check\noccurs above) or to destruction of arbitrary data on the disk.\n\nAdd overflow check for addition operation.\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE."

If such dentry is a directory,\nexportfs_decode_fh_raw() will then try to connect this dentry to the\ndentry tree through reconnect_path(). It may happen for various reasons\n(such as corrupted fs or race with rename) that the call to\nlookup_one_unlocked() in reconnect_one() will fail to find the dentry we\nare trying to reconnect and instead create a new dentry under the\nparent. Now this dentry will not be marked as disconnected although the\nparent still may well be disconnected (at least in case this\ninconsistency happened because the fs is corrupted and .. doesn't point\nto the real parent directory). This creates inconsistency in\ndisconnected flags but AFAICS it was mostly harmless. At least until\ncommit f1ee616214cb (\"VFS: don't keep disconnected dentries on d_anon\")\nwhich removed adding of most disconnected dentries to sb-\u003es_anon list.\nThus after this commit cleanup of disconnected dentries implicitely\nrelies on the fact that dput() will immediately reclaim such dentries.\nHowever when some leaf dentry isn't marked as disconnected, as in the\nscenario described above, the reclaim doesn't happen and the dentries\nare \"leaked\". Memory reclaim can eventually reclaim them but otherwise\nthey stay in memory and if umount comes first, we hit infamous \"Busy\ninodes after unmount\" bug. Make sure all dentries created under a\ndisconnected parent are marked as disconnected as well."

Based on the previous CVE-2023-0597, the 'Randomize per-cpu entry area' feature was implemented in /arch/x86/mm/cpu_entry_area.c, which works through the init_cea_offsets() function when KASLR is enabled. However, despite this feature, there is still a risk of per-cpu entry area leaks. This issue could allow a local user to gain access to some important data with memory in an expected location and potentially escalate their privileges on the system."

The max page sharing of Kernel Samepage Merging (KSM), added in Linux kernel version 4.4.0-96.119, can create a side channel. When the attacker and the victim share the same host and the default setting of KSM is \"max page sharing=256\", it is possible for the attacker to time the unmap to merge with the victim's page. The unmapping time depends on whether it merges with the victim's page and additional physical pages are created beyond the KSM's \"max page share\". Through these operations, the attacker can leak the victim's page."

      "description": "When extracting a tar archive pip may not check symbolic links point into the extraction directory if the tarfile module doesn't implement PEP 706.\nNote that upgrading pip to a \"fixed\" version for this vulnerability doesn't fix all known vulnerabilities that are remediated by using a Python version that implements PEP 706.\n\nNote that this is a vulnerability in pip's fallback implementation of tar extraction for Python versions that don't implement PEP 706\nand therefore are not secure to all vulnerabilities in the Python 'tarfile' module. If you're using a Python version that implements PEP 706\nthen pip doesn't use the \"vulnerable\" fallback code.\n\nMitigations include upgrading to a version of pip that includes the fix, upgrading to a Python version that implements PEP 706 (Python \u003e=3.9.17, \u003e=3.10.12, \u003e=3.11.4, or \u003e=3.12),\napplying the linked patch, or inspecting source distributions (sdists) before installation as is already a best-practice."
